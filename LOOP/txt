# Use for when you know the number of iterations beforehand.

# Use while when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

# Use do...while when you need the code to execute at least once.

# Use for...in to iterate over object keys (but be mindful of its behavior with arrays).

# Use for...of to iterate over iterable objects (arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.). This is generally the preferred way to iterate over arrays.
